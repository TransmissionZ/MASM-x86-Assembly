### Palindrome-MASM-x86-Assembly

I use Irvine and Visual Studio to code in assembly language.

##### Problem Statement/Real World Solution

Iâ€™ve designed a palindrome check which works on both, alphabets and numbers. Palindromes are widely used in biological aspects like DNA marking.
They are also used to change one dimensional chains into 2 or 3 dimensional structure.

Mostly Palindromes are used to create music which have the second half same as the first but backwards making the music enjoyable.
